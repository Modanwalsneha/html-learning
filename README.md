# HTML Learning Repository

This repository contains my HTML practice projects as I learn web development.  
Each file represents a step in my learning journey.

## Files:

- **Day1_BasicHTML.html** → My first HTML page with basic headings and paragraph.  
- **Day2_BasictagsPractice.html** → Practice page for HTML tags including headings, lists, links, images, and text formatting.
- **Day3_ButtonStyling.html** — Button Styling
    Practiced CSS by creating three styled buttons (Subscribe, Join, and Tweet).  
    Learned how to use background color, border radius, and text formatting

## Purpose:

- To practice basic HTML structure and elements.  
- To learn how to upload and manage files on GitHub.  
- To gradually build up knowledge for styling with CSS in future projects.

## Notes:
- Future updates will include CSS styling and interactive elements.
